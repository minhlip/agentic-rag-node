Agent architectures define how AI systems are structured to process information and make decisions. Common patterns include:

- Simple Reflex Agents: React directly to current input
- Model-based Agents: Maintain internal state
- Goal-based Agents: Work towards specific objectives
- Utility-based Agents: Maximize a utility function
- Learning Agents: Improve performance through experience

Agent parallelization allows multiple agents to work simultaneously on different tasks or aspects of a problem.
